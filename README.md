# Messenger Application 
Background and Credits: This project has been assigned to me by Chris Schmidt, my former Object-Oriented Design instructor at Langara College. He assigned us with the task of writing the classes and gave explanations on what the classes needed to include. Chris Schmidt designed the logic and gave me hints while I worked on the classes. However, the implementation of the instructions was done by me, and I have written all of the code in this class.

About the Project: This is a messenger application with a graphical user-interface. It is possible for the user send messages between each other. The application uses multiple classes and has possibility for Multithreading and Networking.
